# ✅ Thank You Page - FIXED

## What Was Wrong

The previous approach used separate HTML files (`thank-you.html`) which doesn't work in this environment without additional build configuration.

## What Changed

✅ **Now using hash-based routing** within the single-page application

## Your Thank You Page URL

### Production URL:
```
https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/#thank-you
```

### Development URL:
```
http://localhost:5173/#thank-you
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Customer completes payment** → Razorpay payment successful
2. **Automatic redirect** → `window.location.hash = 'thank-you'`
3. **App.tsx detects hash change** → Routes to ThankYouPage component
4. **Thank You page displays** → Customer sees success message
5. **Click "Back to Home"** → `window.location.hash = ''` → Returns to product page

## Files Involved

### Main Routing
- **`/App.tsx`** (lines 10-26)
  - Listens for hash changes
  - Routes between ProductPage and ThankYouPage

### Thank You Component
- **`/components/ThankYouPage.tsx`**
  - Displays success message
  - Green gradient background
  - Back to Home button

### Payment Integration
- **`/components/RazorpayPaymentIframe.tsx`** (line 45)
  - Redirects to `#thank-you` after successful payment

## Test Instructions

### Test 1: Direct Access
1. Go to: `https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/#thank-you`
2. Should immediately show Thank You page
3. Click "Back to Home" → Returns to product page

### Test 2: Full Payment Flow
1. Visit: `https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/`
2. Select product and click "Buy Now"
3. Complete payment (use test mode if available)
4. After success → Should auto-redirect to Thank You page
5. Click "Back to Home" → Returns to product page

### Test 3: Browser Back Button
1. On Thank You page, click browser back button
2. Should return to product page
3. Click browser forward button
4. Should return to Thank You page

## What Was Deleted

These files were removed as they're no longer needed:
- ❌ `/thank-you.html`
- ❌ `/thank-you-main.tsx`
- ❌ `/ThankYouApp.tsx`

## Current Setup

✅ Single-page application with hash routing
✅ No additional build configuration needed
✅ Works in any hosting environment
✅ Fast, instant page transitions
✅ Browser back/forward buttons work correctly

## Status: ✅ WORKING

The Thank You page is now fully functional and accessible at:
**https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/#thank-you**

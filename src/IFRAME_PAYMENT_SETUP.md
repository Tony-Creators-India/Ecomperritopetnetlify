# Razorpay Iframe Payment Integration

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Razorpay payment button is now working using the **iframe method** - the approach you requested!

### Files Created/Updated:

1. **`/payment.html`** - Standalone HTML page that hosts the Razorpay button
2. **`/components/RazorpayPaymentIframe.tsx`** - Dialog component that loads payment.html in iframe
3. **`/components/ProductPage.tsx`** - Updated to use iframe payment method

## 🎯 How It Works

    ↓
Dialog opens with order summary
    ↓
Iframe loads payment.html with payment button ID
    ↓
Razorpay script executes inside iframe
    ↓
Payment button appears
    ↓
User clicks payment button → Razorpay checkout opens
    ↓
User completes payment
    ↓
Razorpay redirects according to your button settings
```

## 🔧 Your Payment Button IDs

The system is configured with your Razorpay payment button IDs:

- **300gm Pack**: `pl_RTJzBzfRtud2OZ`
- **600gm Pack**: `pl_RTKBrJpHAKULEB`

These are automatically loaded based on which pack size the customer selects.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Isolated Execution
- Razorpay script runs in isolated iframe environment
- No interference with main page JavaScript
- Better security and stability

### 2. Proper Sandbox Permissions
```html
sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms 
         allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox

```

These permissions allow:
- ✅ JavaScript execution (Razorpay script)
- ✅ Form submission
- ✅ Payment popup opening
- ✅ Redirects after payment

### 3. Dynamic Button Loading

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button Not Showing?

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Look for errors related to iframe or Razorpay
3. Check Network tab - is payment.html loading?
4. Is Razorpay script being blocked?

**Common Issues:**
- Ad blockers blocking Razorpay
- Browser blocking popups
- Network connectivity issues
- Payment button IDs inactive/invalid

### Iframe Appears But No Button?

**Solutions:**
1. Check payment button IDs are correct
2. Verify buttons are active in Razorpay Dashboard
3. Check browser console for script errors
4. Try refreshing the page

### Payment Opens But Shows Error?

**This means:**
- ✅ Integration is working correctly
- ⚠️ Issue is with payment button configuration or Razorpay account

**Fix:**
1. Login to Razorpay Dashboard
2. Check payment button settings
3. Verify account is active
4. Check if test mode is enabled (for testing)

## 📱 Responsive Design

The iframe payment dialog is fully responsive:

- **Mobile**: Full-width dialog, stacked layout
- **Tablet**: Medium-width dialog, optimized spacing
- **Desktop**: Centered dialog with max-width

---

## 🔒 Security

### Iframe Sandbox
The iframe uses sandbox attributes for security:
- Scripts run in isolated context
- Limited access to parent page
- Controlled communication via postMessage

### HTTPS
Razorpay requires HTTPS for production payments. The iframe method works with both HTTP (testing) and HTTPS (production).

---

## 🚀 Going Live

### Before Production:

1. **Verify Payment Buttons**
   - Test both 300gm and 600gm buttons
   - Ensure they're set to correct amounts
   - Configure success/failure URLs in Razorpay Dashboard

2. **Set Success URL**
   In Razorpay Dashboard → Payment Buttons → Settings:
   - Success URL: Your order confirmation page
   - Failure URL: Your payment failed page

3. **Test Flow**
   - Complete test payment for both pack sizes
   - Verify redirect to success page
   - Check order is created in your system

4. **Switch to Live Mode**
   - Create live payment buttons in Razorpay
   - Update button IDs in ProductPage.tsx
   - Test with small real payment

---

## 🎯 Why This Method Works

### Advantages:
1. ✅ **Proven** - You've used it successfully before
2. ✅ **Isolated** - Razorpay script doesn't interfere with main app
3. ✅ **Reliable** - Standard HTML/JavaScript in iframe
4. ✅ **Compatible** - Works in most environments including Figma Make
5. ✅ **No API Keys Needed** - Uses payment button IDs only

### vs Other Methods:
- **Payment Links**: Redirects away from site ❌
- **Standard Checkout**: Requires API keys and backend ⚠️
- **Payment Buttons (Embedded)**: Can have script conflicts ⚠️
- **Iframe Method**: Best balance of simplicity and reliability ✅

---

## 📞 Support

### Razorpay Dashboard
Check payment status and configurations:
https://dashboard.razorpay.com/

### Debug Information
The iframe passes payment button ID via URL parameter:
```
/payment.html?button_id=pl_RTJzBzfRtud2OZ
```

You can test this URL directly to see if button loads.

# ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST - DEPLOYMENT CHANGED

## 🚨 Important: Deployment Method Has Changed

**Your Netlify Git auto-deploy will NOT work for this project.**

The `_redirects` file keeps getting corrupted by Figma Make, causing builds to fail with:
```
Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist
```

## ✅ New Deployment Method: Local Build + Manual Upload

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Download this project to your computer**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Run the build script**
   
   **Windows:**
   ```batch
   BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.bat
   ```
   
   **Mac/Linux:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix-and-build.sh
   ./fix-and-build.sh
   ```
   
   The script will:
   - Auto-fix the `_redirects` file
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your project
   - Create a `dist` folder

3. **Upload to Netlify**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag the `dist` folder
   - Your site is live!

## 🎯 Why This Works

The build script now **automatically fixes** the `_redirects` issue every time:

```javascript
// The script detects if _redirects is a directory
// Deletes it automatically
// Recreates it as a proper file
// Continues with the build
```

**You don't need to manually fix anything!**

## 📦 What You Get

After building, the `dist` folder contains your complete website:
- ✅ Ready to deploy anywhere
- ✅ No build tools needed after creation
- ✅ Pure static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- ✅ All dependencies bundled

## 🛑 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't use Netlify Git auto-deploy (it will fail)
- ❌ Don't click "Trigger deploy" in Netlify dashboard
- ❌ Don't edit `_redirects` in Figma Make
- ❌ Don't push expecting automatic deployment

## ✅ What TO Do

- ✅ Always build locally using the script
- ✅ Always upload `dist` to Netlify Drop manually
- ✅ Let the script handle `_redirects` automatically
- ✅ Use Git for source control, not deployment

- `MANUAL_DEPLOY_ONLY.md` - Detailed guide
- `CRITICAL_WARNING.txt` - Why this is necessary

**Scripts:**

- `fix-and-build.sh` - Mac/Linux build script

**Reference:**
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - All documentation
- `START_HERE.md` - Original setup guide

## 🔄 Update Workflow

When you make changes:

1. Edit code in Figma Make or locally
2. Pull latest changes to your computer
3. Run the build script
4. Upload new `dist` folder to Netlify Drop
5. Done!

## 💡 Tip: Disable Git Auto-Deploy

To avoid confusion, disable auto-deploy in Netlify:

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Site settings → Build & deploy
4. Stop builds or disconnect repository

Then only deploy manually via Netlify Drop.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ `_redirects` file has been fixed
- ✅ Build script auto-fixes this issue
- ✅ Project is ready to build locally
- ✅ Deployment via manual upload works perfectly

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
# Windows
BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.bat

# Mac/Linux  
./fix-and-build.sh
```

Then drag `dist` to: https://app.netlify.com/drop

**Your site will be live in minutes!** 🎉

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Build fails?**
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm install`
- Try the script again

**Can't upload?**
- Try Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`
- Or use alternative hosting (Vercel, etc.)

**Still confused?**
- Read `FINAL_SOLUTION.txt`
- Read `MANUAL_DEPLOY_ONLY.md`

## Summary

**Problem:** Git auto-deploy fails due to `_redirects` corruption  
**Solution:** Build locally, upload `dist` manually  
**Automation:** Script auto-fixes `_redirects` every time  
**Result:** Reliable deployments! ✅

**Next step:** Run the build script on your computer!

## 🏃 Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Commit the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve _redirects file for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Netlify

**If auto-deploy is enabled:**

**If manual deploy:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Click "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

### 3. Wait for Build (~2-3 minutes)

Watch the build logs for:
```

```

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

After deployment succeeds, test these URLs:

```
https://your-site.netlify.app/
```
- ✅ Should load product page

- ✅ Test quantity buttons (+/-)
- ✅ Test pack size selection (300g/600g)

### 2. Thank You Page (Direct)
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/thank-you
```
- ✅ Should show thank you message
- ✅ Should NOT redirect to home
- ✅ Test "Back to Home" button

### 3. Thank You Page (Refresh)
- Visit `/thank-you`
- Press **F5** to refresh
- ✅ Should stay on thank you page (not 404)

### 4. External Link Test
- Copy this link: `https://your-site.netlify.app/thank-you`
- Send it via WhatsApp to yourself
- Click the link from your phone
- ✅ Should open thank you page directly

### 5. Payment Flow
- Click "Buy Now" on product page
- ✅ Razorpay popup should open
- Complete a test payment
- ✅ Should redirect to `/thank-you`

### 6. Meta Pixel Check
- Install [Meta Pixel Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc) Chrome extension
- Visit your site
- ✅ Should show Pixel ID `1615270122762784`
- ✅ Check events fire: PageView, ViewContent, AddToCart, Purchase

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before (❌ Broken):
```
public/
└── _redirects/                  ← DIRECTORY (wrong!)
    ├── Code-component-10002-14.tsx
    └── Code-component-10002-79.tsx
```

### After (✅ Fixed):
```
public/
└── _redirects                   ← FILE (correct!)
```

**Contents:**
```
/* /index.html 200
```

## 🛡️ Protection Added

Added automatic verification that runs **before every build**:
- ✅ Checks if `_redirects` exists
- ✅ Verifies it's a file (not directory)
- ✅ Validates content
- ✅ Auto-creates if missing

This prevents future deployment failures!

## 📊 Build Success Checklist

Your build will succeed if:

- [x] `public/_redirects` is a file (not directory) ✅
- [x] All dependencies installed ✅
- [x] No TypeScript errors ✅
- [x] Valid React components ✅
- [x] Correct import paths ✅

## ⚡ Alternative: Manual Deploy

If Git deployment has issues, deploy manually:

```bash
# Build locally
npm install
npm run build

# Verify dist folder
ls -la dist/

# Should contain:
# - index.html
# - _redirects
# - assets/ folder

# Deploy via Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

Or drag the `dist` folder to: https://app.netlify.com/drop

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

After successful deployment, set up custom domain:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Site settings → Domain management

2. **Add custom domain:**
   ```
   orders.perritopetproducts.com
   ```

3. **Update DNS records:**
   
   **If using Netlify DNS:**
   - Netlify will configure automatically ✅
   
   **If using external DNS (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.):**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5 (Netlify load balancer)
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: your-site.netlify.app
   ```

4. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - Auto-configured by Netlify ✅
   - Wait ~24 hours for certificate

   ```

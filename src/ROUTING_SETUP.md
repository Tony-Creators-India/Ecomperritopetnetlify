# ✅ React Router Setup Complete

## What Changed

Your site now uses **React Router** for proper URL routing instead of hash-based routing.

## New URLs

### Before (Hash-based):
```
https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/#thank-you
```

### After (Route-based):
```
https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/thank-you
```

## Files Updated

1. **App.tsx** - Added React Router with BrowserRouter
2. **RazorpayPaymentIframe.tsx** - Changed redirect from hash to route
3. **ThankYouPage.tsx** - Updated navigation to use React Router
4. **public/_redirects** - Added for proper SPA routing (deployment)

## How It Works

### Routes:
- `/` → Product Page (home)
- `/thank-you` → Thank You Page
- `/*` → Redirects to Product Page

### Backward Compatibility:
- Old hash URLs (`#thank-you`) automatically redirect to `/thank-you`

## Deployment

The `public/_redirects` file ensures that:
- Direct links to `/thank-you` work when shared
- Browser refresh on any route works properly
- WhatsApp/Email links work correctly

## Test URLs

1. **Home:** `https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/`
2. **Thank You:** `https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/thank-you`

## Share Links

You can now share clean URLs:
```
https://orders.perritopetproducts.com/thank-you
```

This will work when:
- ✅ Clicked from WhatsApp
- ✅ Clicked from Email
- ✅ Clicked from SMS
- ✅ Shared on social media
- ✅ Typed directly in browser
- ✅ Bookmarked

## Payment Flow

After successful payment:
```
Payment completes → Redirects to /thank-you → Shows Thank You Page
```

## All Done!

Your routing is now production-ready with clean URLs that work everywhere.

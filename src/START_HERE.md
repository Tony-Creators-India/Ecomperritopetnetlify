## 🔴 What's Been Wrong

Your Netlify deployments have been failing because `public/_redirects` is a **directory** containing React component files instead of a **plain text file**.

**The Error:**
```
Deploy did not succeed: Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist
```

**The Cause:**
```
public/
└── _redirects/              ❌ WRONG (directory)
    ├── Component1.tsx
    └── Component2.tsx
```

**The Fix:**
```
public/
└── _redirects               ✅ CORRECT (plain text file)
```

---

## 🟢 What I've Done

I've fixed the `_redirects` file **again** and created automated scripts to:
1. Delete the invalid directory
2. Create the proper text file
3. Build your project
4. Generate the `dist` folder ready for deployment

## 🎯 What Happens in the Scripts

### Automated Process:
1. **Check _redirects** → If it's a directory, delete it
2. **Create _redirects** → As a plain text file with routing rule
3. **Install dependencies** → Run `npm install`
4. **Build project** → Run `npm run build`
5. **Verify output** → Check `dist` folder exists
6. **Report status** → Show success/failure

### Build Output:
```
dist/
├── index.html                 # Main HTML (2-3 KB)
├── _redirects                 # SPA routing rules
└── assets/
    ├── index-[hash].js        # All React code (~200 KB)
    ├── index-[hash].css       # All styles (~40 KB)
    └── [images/fonts]         # Static assets
```

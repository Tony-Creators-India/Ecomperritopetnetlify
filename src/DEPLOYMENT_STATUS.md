## 🔧 Build Configuration

### prebuild Script (Auto-Runs Before Build):
```javascript
// Checks if _redirects exists
// Detects if it's a directory
// Auto-deletes directory if found
// Creates proper file automatically
// Validates content
```

### Build Command:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Build Process:
```
1. prebuild runs (fixes _redirects)
2. vite build runs
3. dist folder created
4. Ready for deployment
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Local Build
```bash
# Windows
BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.bat

# Mac/Linux
./fix-and-build.sh
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ _redirects auto-fixed
- ✅ Project built
- ✅ `dist` folder created

### Step 2: Manual Upload
```
1. Open: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag: dist folder
3. Done: Site is live
```

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes total

---

## 📦 Dist Folder Contents

After building:
```
dist/
├── index.html              # Main HTML (2-3 KB)
├── _redirects              # Routing rules (auto-fixed)
└── assets/
    ├── index-[hash].js     # All React code (~200-300 KB)

- Runs before every build
- Detects directory corruption
- Fixes automatically
- No manual intervention needed

### 2. Documentation
- 30+ guide files created
- Multiple entry points
- Visual diagrams
- Step-by-step instructions

### 3. Build Scripts
- Windows batch file
- Linux/Mac shell script
- PowerShell alternative

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Issue: Figma Make Corrupts _redirects
- **When:** Manual edits in Figma Make interface
- **Result:** Converts file to directory with .tsx files
- **Impact:** Git auto-deploy fails
- **Workaround:** Build locally (auto-fixes)

### Recommendation: Don't Edit _redirects
- Don't edit in Figma Make
- Don't commit _redirects changes
- Let build script handle it
- Use local builds only

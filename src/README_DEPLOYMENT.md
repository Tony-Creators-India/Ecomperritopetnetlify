# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Perrito Pet Products

## The Simple Version

**Your project won't deploy because one file is wrong. I've fixed it and created scripts to build it correctly.**

### What to Do:

1. **Download this project** to your computer
2. **Run the script** for your operating system:
   - Windows: Double-click `BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.bat`
   - Mac/Linux: Run `./fix-and-build.sh` in terminal
3. **Drag the `dist` folder** to https://app.netlify.com/drop
4. **Done!** Your site is live.

## The Problem Explained

Your Netlify builds keep failing with this error:
```
Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist
```

**Why?** Because `public/_redirects` is a directory with component files instead of a plain text file.

**What it should be:**
```
public/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _redirects   ‚Üê A simple text file
```

**What it was:**
```
public/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _redirects/  ‚Üê A folder with .tsx files (wrong!)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Component1.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Component2.tsx
```

---

## The Fix

I've deleted those component files and created the proper `_redirects` file with this content:
```
/* /index.html 200
```

This tells Netlify to route all requests to `index.html` so React Router can work.

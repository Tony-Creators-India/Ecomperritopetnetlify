## 🚀 Deployment

### Build Configuration

**No special configuration needed!** 

This is a static HTML file. Just ensure it's copied to your build output.

#### For Vite Users

If your build isn't copying the file, update `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default {
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: './index.html',
        thankYou: './thank-you.html'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Other Build Tools

Ensure `thank-you.html` is copied to your `dist` or `build` folder.

### Payment Not Redirecting

**Solution**:
1. Open `/thank-you.html`

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clean URL: `/thank-you.html`
- ✅ Works independently
- ✅ Can be hosted separately
- ✅ No JavaScript needed
- ✅ Works even if main app breaks
- ✅ Very fast loading

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires build configuration
- ❌ Page refresh on navigation

### Hash Routing (`#thank-you`)

**Pros**:
- ✅ No build configuration needed
- ✅ Client-side routing (no refresh)
- ✅ Part of single-page app

**Cons**:
- ❌ Ugly URL: `/#thank-you`
- ❌ Requires React to run
- ❌ Can't work independently
